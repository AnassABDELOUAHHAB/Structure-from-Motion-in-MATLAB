## Project Overview  
This MATLAB-based project implements **incremental 3D reconstruction** from a sequence of images to estimate:  
- **3D point cloud** of the scene  
- **Camera poses** (rotation `R` and translation `t`) for each image  

Built as part of the ENSEIRB Matmeca curriculum, the pipeline follows the Structure from Motion (SfM) methodology, assuming pre-computed keypoint correspondences (outlier-free).

## Key Features  
- **Incremental Reconstruction**: Adds images iteratively while refining poses and 3D points.  
- **Bundle Adjustment**: Minimizes reprojection error using the **Levenberg-Marquardt** algorithm.  
- **Sparse Jacobian Optimization**: Efficiently handles large-scale problems with MATLABâ€™s `sparse` matrices.  
- **Visualization**: Supports `pointCloud()` for interactive 3D exploration or `plot3()` for basic plotting.  
- **Error Analysis**: Tracks reprojection errors before/after refinement.
